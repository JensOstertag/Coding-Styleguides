# General Coding Style Guide
While some Language-spcific Styles from the corresponding Style Guides might not be used in some Projects (there are a Variety of Reasons to do that, most Times it's due to Simplicity or personal Choice), <b>these General Rules do always apply</b>.
Deviating Styles are supposed to be widely accepted, most important by possible Collaborators.

## Clear Code
It's very important to have clear Code as it improves understandibility for Collaborators or other Developers. This Chapter will focus on how to keep Code clear.

### Uniformity
Keeping the Code unified is a first step to writing clear Code. This means that there are Rules that specify how e.g. horizontal or vertical Whitespaces, Letter Capitalizations or Braces are used. 

### Splitting long Code Parts
When a Code Part is longer than a few Lines, it may be split with a vertical Whitespace. However, this shouldn't be done unreasonable, Lines building up on each other or Lines that serve a similar Purpose - short: Lines, that belong together - should be kept together, if possible. This Way, the Code can be organized into logical Subsections.

Those Code Parts can then be ordered by a Variety of Criteria: Importance (most important first), Usage (first used first) and many other that depend on your Situation. Some of them might also appear in the Language-specific Style Guides.

## Verbal Language
Every Piece of Code is written in English, since it is the World Language understandable by (almost) everyone. This affects e.g. File and Variable Naming, Comments, ...

Descriptions and (Code) Documentations are at Least written in English and may be available in additional Languages.
